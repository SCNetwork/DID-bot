<hr>
On our <a href="https://sc-net.work/dc">Discord</a>-Server we had some users dealing with a Dissociative identity disorder, who
always wrote their current identity at the end of their message (e.g. "-alex"). To make the experience smoother for everyone, we 
decided to write this short script.

<a href="https://youtu.be/Ti6TrZAUL1M" target="_blank">Demo on YouTube</a>

If you are a member on our Discord-Server and have DID, please message `SCDerox#4645` to set this up. If you want to
self-host this, read further.

This script should be pretty easy to use, we have provided a <a href="config.example.json">config.example.json</a>-file
with the setup.

Please note that this was built in less than 30 minutes and only to make the communication of our members easier.
Because of this, we haven't written a complicated documentation here, but feel free to ask questions (here or on Discord)
or raise a pull-request if you want something added.
